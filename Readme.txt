A 13 person, 3 month long project. We used visual studio, the XNA framework and IronPython library.
Most of the code is written in c#.
I was the leader of the game engine/client team,
responsible for some of the implementation of the game,
as well as integration of the menus, server and client GUI's.

Important to note: the game was finished as a class project quite some time ago.
As such the server may or may not still be functioning by the time you read this.
